## Employee Directory

-   Used axios to obtain a randomuser api database.

-   I created my state for employees

-   I then created by components and used props to obtain email, phone number and location.

-   I used the filter and sort methods while creating the buttons on by home.js that would
    create the funcitonality to filer by name or sort. I then rendered.
